# Open National Parks Map

This repository holds code to extract National Parks from open source data.
The start point is to extract from Open Street Maps,
querying for each country in Natural Earth for tags related to National Parks.



WHY?

Besides IUCN holds a World database on protected areas, it is not open for
comercial use. So if you are looking for open data this project can be helpful.
