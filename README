# Open National Parks Map

This repository holds code to create a Worldwide National Parks dataset from open source data.
The start point is to extract from Open Street Maps, thanks to this great project we are able to
query national parks for each country present in Natural Earth dataset, looking for tags of interest.

In a hurry? We got you covered with the lattest result ready to download at

WHY?

Besides IUCN holds a World database on protected areas, it is not open for
comercial use. So if you are looking for open data this project can be helpful.
